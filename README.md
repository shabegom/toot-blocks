## Toot Blocks

It all started when Eleanor found out you could do poetry/prose codeblocks:

I thought it would be fun to riff on the theme:

Little did I know how high the demand was for codeblocks that turned words into fart emojis. As a result the Toot Blocks plugin was born.

### To Install
This is never going to be submitted to the community plugins, let's face it. So install it manually or with BRAT.

### How to use

1. Create a codeblock of type `farts` or `toots`
2. Write in the block
3. Watch your words magically transform into fart emojis.
